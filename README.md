# HumanDetectionROBOT
With advancement in technology and embedded systems, the world is being introduced with new and magical innovations that can create wonders and help the mankind on a large scale. Embedded systems are an integral part of our world today and daily life can come to a halt if they donâ€™t work in a smooth manner. 
Now, these embedded systems and devices are not limited to just making our home or cities smart or playing some music etc. but also, they can be and are being used to help the humans in a better way. this project aims to develop one of those ways and make great changes when it comes to use of embedded systems. This project aims to give a practical design, to build a human detection robot which will be controlled by an operator in areas affected by natural calamities, like an earthquake or flood. Detection of human in appropriate time is very important in such situations and can be done using this robot. Thus it can aid rescue missions in a great way.
